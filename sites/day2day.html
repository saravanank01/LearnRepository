 <h1> Log of how I spent my time today .</h1>
 <ol>
 	<li>14.01.24 Learned create,delete and merging of branches in git.</li>
    <li>15.01.24 Solved one easy hackerank and codechef problem. revised cmd : 1 git status -s (short) - shows use the files and stage status (M- modified files,A- new file to staging area, ?? - files not added, D -deleted, R - file renamed ); git diff --staged.2 git diff --cached : staged and cached are synonyms ;3 git difftool file_path(open Vim to see the difference between staged and previous) ;4 git remove : I've added a sample txt file and then removing it using "git rm testing_remove_file" (it will completely remove the file from the directory) ;5 git rm --cached file_path : Incase you want to remove a file from staging area not from the working tree, use --cached in git rm. Also we can use file-glob patterns to the git rm cmd like git rm \*.txt (this will rm all file with .txt) ; 6 git mv old_file_name new_file_name ; git log -p -5 : git log shows every commit in recent order.Option -p or --patch with -num  to show the difference in each commit and the -#num limit the number of logs to show.</li>
