 <p> Here, the content about git merge from "branch1-content" will be merged I guess.</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

>>>>>>> quick-test
  <p> Now , I've created a new branch named "branch1-content". In that branch, i added a new html file. Now I'm going to merge main and branch1 locally using "git merge".Before that, i want to double check the see the code that are merging in which i can do with get diff.  </p>
  <p>Before merging the subbranch with the main branch, we want to push the subbranch to github. To do that, we simply right git push..Oh No!,it result it error!. It wants us to first set up the subbranch to push. </p>
  <p>Now i'm going to delete the branch using cmd : git branch -d branch1-content in local. To delete the branch on remote, git push --delete origin branch1-content.</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD

  <p>quick-test : Now, I'm going to create a new branch to test merge conflict while merging.</p> 

=======
  <p>main : Now, I'm going to create a new branch to test merge conflict while merging.</p>
>>>>>>> main
  <p>Now, I am going to undo the changes using git reset HEAD~1 (HEAD points to the last commit and ~1 means revert to one commit before). This will unstage the commit, but it won't reflect it.To reflect the change we need to commit it.
  </p>
  <p>Inorder to reflect the changes, we can make the reset git reset --hard 'commit_id' . To get the commit id, use git log (it will show the log in reverse chronological order).</p>
  <p>Git Commands learned on 15.01.2024 : 1 git status -s (short) - shows use the files and stage status (M- modified files,A- new file to staging area, ?? - files not added, D -deleted, R - file renamed ); git diff --staged.2 git diff --cached : staged and cached are synonyms ;3 git difftool file_path(open Vim to see the difference between staged and previous) ;4 git rm file_path : I've added a sample txt file and then removing it using "git rm testing_remove_file" (it will completely remove the file from the directory) ;5 git rm --cached file_path : Incase you want to remove a file from staging area not from the working tree, use --cached in git rm. Also we can use file-glob patterns to the git rm cmd like git rm \*.txt (this will rm all file with .txt) ; 6 git mv old_file_name new_file_name ;7 git log -p -5 : git log shows every commit in recent order.Option -p or --patch with -num  to show the difference in each commit and the -#num limit the number of logs to show ; 8 git log --stat: show how many file and/or lines changed ; 9 git log --pretty=oneline/short/full/fuller/format:"%h %an %s" : these prints each commit on a single line, which is useful if you’re looking at a lot of commits. format:"" , allows you to specify your own log output. --graph option to the oneline and format makes the log looks nice with ASCII graph.
format ; 10 git log --since=2.weeks : these are time limiting options which fetch commit details of last 2 weeks. --since or --after Limit the commits to those made after the specified date ;</p>
 <p> <strong> 29.01.24 :</strong> 
  git log --until= 2.weeks :Limit the commits to those made before the specified date ;
  git log --author=name : this command fetch those commit did by the author ; 
  git log --grep="^added" -i --all-match: this --grep option is similar to the command in linux shell. This is used to match pattern in the commit message string. -i option is used to make the pattern match to case insensitive. --all-match - limits the ouput to those commits that match all --grep pattern ;
  git log -S function_name : this -S filter is search for commits that introduce or remove a particular line of source code.This is called <strong>pickaxe</strong>. ;
