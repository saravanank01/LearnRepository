 <p> Here, the content about git merge from "branch1-content" will be merged I guess.</p>
=======
  <p> Now , I've created a new branch named "branch1-content". In that branch, i added a new html file. Now I'm going to merge main and branch1 locally using "git merge".Before that, i want to double check the see the code that are merging in which i can do with get diff.  </p>
  <p>Before merging the subbranch with the main branch, we want to push the subbranch to github. To do that, we simply right git push..Oh No!,it result it error!. It wants us to first set up the subbranch to push. </p>
  <p>Now i'm going to delete the branch using cmd : git branch -d branch1-content in local. To delete the branch on remote, git push --delete origin branch1-content.</p>
